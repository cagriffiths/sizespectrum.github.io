## SPECTRE (Size sPECTrum REading group) 

The aim of SPECTRE is to bring the size spectrum community closer by providing a
platform where colleagues from different regions can meet and talk about
applying the size spectrum theory in aquatic communities. Starting in February
2021, the group will meet virtually once every two months to discuss a paper or
a general question relevant to the topic. The meetings are not obligatory, and
the participants can join the ones they find interesting.
